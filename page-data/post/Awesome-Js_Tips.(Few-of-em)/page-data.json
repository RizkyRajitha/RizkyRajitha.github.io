But the thing is you cannot use <code class=\"language-text\">break</code> statements inside <code class=\"language-text\">array.forEach()</code> so, let's say after meeting a specific condition your <code class=\"language-text\">forEach</code> loop needs to stop. But you can't do it in <code class=\"language-text\">forEach</code> loop. That's where our friend <code class=\"language-text\">for (let item of array)</code> comes. This does exactly what <code class=\"language-text\">array.forEach()</code> do, but we get the option to <code class=\"language-text\">break</code> the <code class=\"language-text\">forloop</code> anytime we want in any breakpoint.\nOf course, you can use a regular for loop for this. But this is a pretty clean way to get the job done<br>\n<code class=\"language-text\">gist:RizkyRajitha/ef461d86fc6116f066fa694d2af5bf08</code></li>\n</ol>\n</span>\n<h2>So, did i miss anything ðŸ‘€,You can leave a comment and i'll include your awesome tips in this article.And i will keep this post updated with my findings.</h2>\n<h2>Cheers ðŸ¥‚ , Have a Nice day.</h2>","frontmatter":{"title":"Awesome Js Tips.(Few of em )","date":"November 26, 2019","description":null,"ogimage":"Awesome-Js_Tips.(Few-of-em).png"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/post/How-i-build-my-first-npm-package command-line-chat-application/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How i build my first npm package, a command line chat application"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/post/whats-inside-qr-codes/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"what's inside QR codes"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"89784bee-14c8-562f-91c5-6a0ce09f3e93","previousPostId":"4a5cecff-affa-5a14-83eb-1d900358cb1c","nextPostId":"98b0c502-cb6a-5e61-9d67-e3be1d99c2f5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"],"slicesMap":{}}
