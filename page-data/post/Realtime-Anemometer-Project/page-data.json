Which is the main reason it is widely used in IoT applications.</p>\n<p>here we have 3 main parts</p>\n<ol>\n<li>wind speed detector developed with and nodemcu</li>\n<li>node API that handles historical data for the graph</li>\n<li>react web application to show real-time data and also historical data of the wind speeds</li>\n</ol>\n<p>wind speed is detected from an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_encoder#Optical_absolute_encoders\">optical encoder</a> that counts how many turns the wind cups are turned within a given time. nothing fancy there.</p>\n<p>and when coming to wind speed data, I only collected average and also max wind speeds within an hour and write that data to the database. from this data historical data graphs are created for the last day, last week, and you guessed it last month XD</p>\n<p>and that's pretty much it. most of the software is done now. only need a bit of polishing. but hardware is needed to be weatherproofed for actual uses</p>\n<p>after developing the API I chose to deploy it on a local running <a href=\"http://www.orangepi.org/orangepizero/\">orange pi</a>. orange pi is a budget alternative for well-known <a href=\"https://www.raspberrypi.org/\">raspberry pi</a>. orangepi is an opensource and developed china based company. it is pretty good for a small project like this.</p>\n<span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative;
