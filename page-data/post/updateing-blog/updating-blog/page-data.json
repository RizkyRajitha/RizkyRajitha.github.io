I also added Cloudflare as DNS, I actually added it previously but removed it again due to a few debugging issues I had that time but this time I decided to keep it.</p>\n<p>I originally added comments and view count sections for this blog and it was hosted in heroku, but heroku free tier was <a href=\"https://help.heroku.com/RSBRUH58/removal-of-heroku-free-product-plans-faq\">canceled</a> by them (acctually quite some time ago), so i need to migrate those applications to some other place.and i am thinking of using a selfhost comments service like <a href=\"https://remark42.com/demo/\">remark42</a>. for analytics i use <a href=\"https://umami.is/\">umami</a> which is working great. it has an easy to use UI , plain and simple with many useful features.</p>\n<p>Apart from blogs i setup <a href=\"https://jellyfin.org/\">Jellyfin</a> as my home media server. it was SuperDuper useful app, packed with tons of feature and ease of use. All devices that i use had support for jelly which is awesome.</p>\n<p>Looking forward to write more blogs but time is the only enemy, which is same for all humans i guess.</p>\n<h2>Cheers ðŸ¥‚ , Have a Nice day.</h2>","frontmatter":{"title":"Updating Blog","date":"December 29, 2023","description":null,"ogimage":"updating-blog.png"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/post/setup-prometheus-and-grafana-on-orange-pi/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Setup Prometheus and Grafana on Orange Pi"}},"next":null},"pageContext":{"id":"f1296ea1-759b-5292-9a47-053553e28d11","previousPostId":"1e1ede0c-1fb4-573b-805f-6664b223c8a8","nextPostId":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"],"slicesMap":{}}
