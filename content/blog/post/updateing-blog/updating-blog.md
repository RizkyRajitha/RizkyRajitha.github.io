## Hi there Me after a long time

It's been quite some time since I wrote a blog post here, many things have gone deprecated and obsolete so I updated everything to get things back on track.at the time I created this blog gatsby was a v2 and now it is v5, and some packages I used back then are now not maintained at all, so I had to rewrite and update those functionalities. with some effort everything is working great. I also added Cloudflare as DNS, I actually added it previously but removed it again due to a few debugging issues I had that time but this time I decided to keep it.

i originally added comments and view count sections for this blog and it was hosted in heroku, but heroku free tier was [canceled](https://help.heroku.com/RSBRUH58/removal-of-heroku-free-product-plans-faq) by them (acctually quite some time ago), so i need to migrate those applications to some other place.and i am thinking of using a selfhost comments server like [remark42](https://remark42.com/demo/). for analytics i use [umami](https://umami.is/) which is working great. it has really greate and easy to use UI , plain and simple with many useful features.

Apart from blogs i setup jellyfin as my home media server. it was really great app. packed with tons of feature and ease of use. all devices that i use had support for [jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/) which is super awesome.

Looking forward to write more blogs but time is the only enemy, which is same for all humans i guess.

## Cheers ðŸ¥‚ , Have a Nice day.
