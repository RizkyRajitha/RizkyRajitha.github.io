## Hi everyone,

---

<span style="font-size:1.28rem;">
This is the first official post of my personal Blog. 
I wonâ€™t bore you with some code example , for now ðŸ˜‰.
so i will give a small walk around about the tech stack this blog.

This is a MERN stack application.
meaning
backend powered by [ExpressJs](https://expressjs.com/)
database is [MongoDb](https://www.mongodb.com/) and front end [ReactJs](https://reactjs.org/) . which is a quite popular tech stack in 2019.
<br/>
<br/>
[Mongo](https://www.mongodb.com/) [Express](https://expressjs.com/) [React](https://reactjs.org/) [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) makes the MERN acronym.

let's start with the frontend.
so as i said before i used react to build frontend app .bootstrap for styling. and responsive react modal for the popup in comment section.
pretty standard stuff.

backend is build using ExpressJs . the reason whole backed is existing is because i implemented a commenting section .In original design i thought only to post without any comments, but later changed my mind as usual. after keeping track of comments, i implemented a views counter just out of curiosity.First version was not good. i mean i got a new view for every page refresh .So i improve it and now a bit better than the previous counter.

for hosting frontend is hosted in [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/).
and backend is hosted in [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/home) server.

I will later write a post about both of them

so that's it.
I'll try to post frequently with my findings.

thanks for reading so far.
have a nice day
